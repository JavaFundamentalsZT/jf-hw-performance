JVM Troubleshooting and Performance Homework
============

This project has an implemention for the [N-puzzle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifteen_puzzle). The board is a
little bit bigger though, 5x5. The project uses the class `org.zeroturnaround.jf.performance.Main` for benchmarking
the implementation. It uses the A* algorithm by default but is bundled with depth first and breadth first approaches
also.

Your homework for this project is to send a half page of thoughts (maximum 2 pages), findings, reasoning and or performance numbers to jf@zeroturnaround.com

To get you started I've composed a set of tasks and questions that you can ask yourself while composing the submission.

* Run a profiler and a debugger on the program
* Try to figure out how it works
* Give your feedback about the implementation
 * What do you think of it?
 * Do you think it performs well?
 * Is it well written?
 * If you think it is slow then why do you think it is slow?
 * If you think it is optimal then why do you think that?
* Feel free to play around with the source and try to tweak it and run more measurements
* Spend a minimum of an hour on this.
