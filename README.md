JVM Troubleshooting and Performance Homework
============

This project has an implemention for the N-puzzle ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifteen_puzzle ). The board is a
little bit bigger though, 5x5. The project uses the class `org.zeroturnaround.jf.performance.Main` for benchmarking
the implementation. It uses the A* algorithm by default but is bundled with depth first and breadth first approaches
also.

Your homework for this project is:

* Run a profiler and a debugger on the program.
* High level give your assessment to the program
 * What do you think of it?
 * Is it well written?
 * If you think it is slow then why do you think it is slow?
* Feel free to play around with the source and try to tweak it

Send a paragraph of text on minimum about this to jf@zeroturnaround.com
